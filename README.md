# Distributed-DeepLearning-CXR
Repository of my thesis work in Computer Science Engineering @ PolitecnicoDiMilano focused on Distributed Deep Learning approaches with Chest X-Rays.

- CheXpert dataset available online at https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/

- TFFederated_coarse_grain.ipynb and TFFederated_fine_grain.ipynb notebooks for training of coarse and fine grain Federated models.

- SplitLearning_launcher.ipynb notebook for training Split Learning models.

- WriteTFrecords.ipynb notebook to build TFrecords CheXpert data based on .csv files.

- csv.zip: contains data splitting per-clients, used to build TFrecords of Uniform and Unbalanced datasets.
